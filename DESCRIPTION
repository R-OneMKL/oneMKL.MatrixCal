Description: The "oneMKL.MatrixCal" package provides an efficient and powerful tool for conducting linear algebra computations in the R environment. It achieves this by utilizing the optimized algorithms embedded in the IntelÂ® oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL) to accelerate matrix operations, such as factorization, inversion, and multiplication. To ensure proper installation, users must first install the "oneMKL" package to establish the connection between R and oneMKL. The package also supports multithreaded computations, enabling users to utilize multiple CPU cores for faster and more accurate performance on large-scale matrix computations. Its compatibility with Windows and Linux operating systems makes it a versatile option for many users.
