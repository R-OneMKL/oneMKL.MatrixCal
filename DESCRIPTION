Description: The "oneMKL.MatrixCal" package provides an efficient and powerful tool for
  conducting linear algebra computations in the R environment. In the package,
  matrix operations, such as decompositio, inversion, and multiplication,
  are performed using the optimized algorithms embedded in the
  Intel oneAPI Math Kernel Library ("oneMKL"). Because of this feature,
  the computational performance can be significantly improved. To make the package
  function work correctly with Intel "oneMKL", users must first install the package,
  "oneMKL", to import Intel "oneMKL" into R. The package also supports multithreaded
  computations, enabling users to utilize the benefit of multiple CPU cores,
  i.e., parallel computing, to handle large-scale matrix computations.
  The package is not only compatible with Linux, but aslo Windows operating systems,
  which can benefit a wide range of users.
